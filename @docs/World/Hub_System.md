# Eden One City: Quantum-Detailed Narrative & Experiential Design

## Overview
Eden One City is the central hub of AINCRAD, designed as an immersive, modular city inspired by Disney/Universal theming, with water, glass, floating gardens, and starlit vistas. Each district is a story world, blending narrative, technology, and nature. This section details the narrative, experiential goals, and modular code structure for each major zone.

## Zone Narratives & Experiential Goals

### 1. Unity Spire (Central Hub)
- **Narrative:** The crystalline heart of Eden One City, housing the AI core, observation decks, and main portal. Beacon of hope, knowledge, and unity.
- **Experiential:** Verticality, transparency, AI host, panoramic starlit views, portal room.

### 2. Starlake (Surrounds Unity Spire)
- **Narrative:** Circular lake with floating gardens and bioluminescent flora, symbolizing connection to nature and cosmos.
- **Experiential:** Water taxis, floating walkways, glowing plants, social events.

### 3. Cultural Crescent
- **Narrative:** Celebration of Earth's diversity with museums, amphitheaters, and floating pavilions.
- **Experiential:** Rotating exhibitions, live performances, water taxis, AR overlays.

### 4. Emotional Biome Gardens
- **Narrative:** Floating gardens that respond to visitor emotions, blending nature, art, and technology.
- **Experiential:** Mycelium bridges, meditation domes, interactive art, AI gardeners.

### 5. Love Creature Haven
- **Narrative:** Sanctuaries for bioengineered animals and fantastical creatures.
- **Experiential:** Glass tunnels, creature bonding, petting lagoons, AR overlays.

### 6. Memory Coastline
- **Narrative:** Tranquil coastal zone for reflection, healing, and memory exploration.
- **Experiential:** Sensory pools, memory beaches, AR/VR experiences, memory lanterns.

### 7. Zero-G Dome
- **Narrative:** Weightless play zone and sky lounge for stargazing and floating gardens.
- **Experiential:** Zero-g sports, glass floors/ceilings, dynamic music/light shows.

### 8. Stargate Plaza
- **Narrative:** Interstellar travel hub with portal activation rings and resonance arenas.
- **Experiential:** Water mirrors, portal puzzles, AI gatekeepers, lore events.

### 9. Interstitial Spaces
- **Narrative:** Canals, skybridges, and hidden groves connect all districts.
- **Experiential:** Panoramic movement, quiet groves, bioluminescent pathways.

## Modular Code Structure
- See `World/CityZone.h` for the modular base class for all city hub zones.
- See `World/CityZoneRegistry.h` for the registry/manager pattern.
- Example zones: `World/UnitySpireZone.h`, `World/StarlakeZone.h`.

## Usage Example
- Each zone is a subclass of `ACityZone` and registered with `UCityZoneRegistry`.
- Zones can be extended, connected, and iterated for gameplay, AI, and visualization.

## System Context
- Eden One City is the launchpad for all ages/worlds in AINCRAD.
- Designed for extensibility, narrative immersion, and seamless player experience.
