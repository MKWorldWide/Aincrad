## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **CMake** 3.14 or higher
- **C++17** compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **Google Test** for testing framework
- **JsonCpp** for configuration management
- **Unreal Engine 5** (for full game development)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aincrad.git
cd aincrad

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build the project
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Running the Asset Management System

```bash
# Build the asset CLI tool
cmake --build . --target aincrad-asset

# Use the asset management system
./bin/aincrad-asset --help
```

## 🎯 Core Systems

### Asset Management
The heart of Aincrad's cross-platform capabilities:

```cpp
// Initialize asset manager
auto assetManager = std::make_unique<Aincrad::World::AssetManager>();

// Load assets with platform-specific optimization
auto asset = assetManager->loadAsset("sword_model");
if (asset && asset->isLoaded()) {
    // Use asset in game
}
```

### Combat System
Advanced third-person combat with VR support:

```cpp
// Player character with combat capabilities
auto player = std::make_unique<Aincrad::Characters::PlayerCharacter>();
player->initializeCombatSystem();

// Weapon system with durability and chaining
auto weapon = std::make_unique<Aincrad::Combat::WeaponComponent>();
weapon->setWeaponType(WeaponType::Sword);
weapon->enableComboSystem();
```

### Skill System
Dynamic skill progression and management:

```cpp
// Skill system with cooldown management
auto skillSystem = std::make_unique<Aincrad::Skills::SkillSystemComponent>();
skillSystem->addSkill("Sword Art", SkillType::Combat, 5.0f);
skillSystem->addSkill("Healing", SkillType::Support, 10.0f);
```
