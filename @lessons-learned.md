## Documentation Best Practices
- Maintain quantum-detailed documentation for all components
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Use @docs/ directory as the source of truth
- Cross-reference related documentation for better context
- Document component dependencies and requirements

## Project Organization
- Modular architecture helps maintain clean separation of concerns
- Directory structure should reflect system components
- Documentation should be maintained at both project and component levels
- Component-based design allows for flexible system integration
- Clear separation between C++ and Blueprint implementations

## Development Insights
- SAO-inspired mechanics require careful balance and implementation
- Terminal interface provides unique user experience
- Multiple interconnected systems need clear documentation of interactions
- Third-person combat system needs careful attention to animation and timing
- Skill system should be extensible for future additions
- Enemy AI needs to account for weak spot mechanics

## Technical Implementation
- Unreal Engine 5 provides robust foundation for MMORPG development
- C++ components should be exposed to Blueprints for flexibility
- Networking considerations should be planned from the start
- Performance optimization needed for networked play
- Draw calls should be minimized for better performance

## Areas for Improvement
- Need to establish detailed API documentation
- Consider implementing automated documentation updates
- Plan for comprehensive testing strategy
- Implement input validation and anti-cheat measures
- Develop networking infrastructure for multiplayer
- Create more detailed component interaction documentation

## Security Considerations
- Implement input validation
- Add anti-cheat hooks
- Secure networking protocols
- Validate client-server communication
- Protect against common game exploits
